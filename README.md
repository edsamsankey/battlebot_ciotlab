# battlebot_ciotlab
Overview

This project is a detailed CAD design of a Battle Bot created as part of a robotics/mechanical engineering project. The design focuses on modularity, allowing easy swapping of chassis configurations and weapon systems for testing and optimization.

Components

- Chassis Designs

Chassis V1 (Lightweight Frame):
Focused on agility and speed. Features compact motor mounts and reduced weight for quick maneuvers.

Chassis V2 (Reinforced Frame):
Built for durability and heavy impacts. Includes reinforced armor plates and shock-resistant joints.

- Weapon System

Axial double-blade spinner designed to store high kinetic energy and deliver wide-impact strikes. Symmetrical crescent blades ensure dynamic balance and use replaceable hardened edges for quick maintenance. Central rigid hub/shaft mounting provides high-RPM stability while controlling gyroscopic effects.

Design Features

Modular weapon mounting system for easy replacement.

Optimized center of gravity for stability during impacts.

Component-level separation for ease of manufacturing and simulation.

Assembly modeled in Fusion 360 

- Future Work

Simulation of impact and stress analysis (FEA).

Integration with motor and sensor mounts.

Complete drivetrain and battery placement.
