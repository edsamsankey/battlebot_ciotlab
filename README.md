# battlebot_ciotlab
Overview

This project is a detailed CAD design of a Battle Bot created as part of a robotics/mechanical engineering project. The design focuses on modularity, allowing easy swapping of chassis configurations and weapon systems for testing and optimization.

Components

- Chassis Designs

Chassis V1 (Lightweight Frame):
Focused on agility and speed. Features compact motor mounts and reduced weight for quick maneuvers.

Chassis V2 (Reinforced Frame):
Built for durability and heavy impacts. Includes reinforced armor plates and shock-resistant joints.

- Weapon System

Rotating Drum Weapon:
Designed for maximum kinetic impact. High moment of inertia with strategically placed mass distribution for stable rotation and destructive hits.

Design Features

Modular weapon mounting system for easy replacement.

Optimized center of gravity for stability during impacts.

Component-level separation for ease of manufacturing and simulation.

Assembly modeled in Fusion 360 

- Future Work

Simulation of impact and stress analysis (FEA).

Integration with motor and sensor mounts.

Complete drivetrain and battery placement.
